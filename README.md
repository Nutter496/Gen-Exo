# Gen-Exo
Procedural Generation of Exoplanets

This is my first readme I've ever written

At the start, to check the process works, the code will only be concerning itself with stars that are identical to the Sun.
From the solar clones we will produce histograms showing the distributions of the planetary systems. 
The graphs should have similar characteristics to those produced by Sullivan et al. 2015.
This is the summary of the beginning stage of this project.
